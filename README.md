php_email_invite
================

A program to email personalized party invitations to up to 10 email addresses.

Create a PHP form that takes up to 10 names and email addresses, and a PHP program that uses a text file as a template to send out personalized party invitations to each email address. The text file template should be altered in each case to include the invitee's name. The PHP program should then confirm the party list by listing all valid email addresses to which the invitation was sent.  No form validation is wanted, meaning no action is needed for an invalid email address.
When you've finished, hand in your PHP form and your PHP program. 

Want to show off? Alter your form to include a File Upload form element to upload your party list in Microsoft Excel CSV (comma-delimited) format. (This is optional!)
